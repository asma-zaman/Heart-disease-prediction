# Heart Disease Predictor using Machine Learning Models
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical and demographic features. The models implemented here leverage machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions.


Features
Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset containing medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant factors that contribute to heart disease risk.

Models Used: Several machine learning algorithms are explored and compared to find the most effective predictor for heart disease. Here I have used logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and KNN. The most satisfying one was logistic regressor.

Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,Mean Squared Error (MSE) to calculate how well the model predicts the presence or absence of heart disease.
